# Java N-Layer Architecture Package Structure

In a modern Java project, especially using a framework like **Spring Boot**, the N-Layer architecture is often implemented by dividing the codebase into packages that correspond to the logical layers:

* **`com.example.app.controller`**: Contains the **Presentation Layer** code.

* **`com.example.app.service`**: Contains the **Business Logic Layer** code.

* **`com.example.app.repository`** or **`com.example.app.dao`**: Contains the **Data Access Layer** code.

* **`com.example.app.model`** or **`com.example.app.domain`**: Contains the data structures (**POJOs/Entities**) shared between layers.

```java
com.mycompany.myapp
├── **controller** (Presentation Layer)
│   ├── UserResource.java  // Handles REST/Web requests
│   └── OrderController.java
├── **service** (Business Logic Layer)
│   ├── UserService.java     // Implements business rules
│   └── OrderService.java
├── **repository** (Data Access Layer)
│   ├── UserRepository.java  // Handles database interaction
│   └── OrderRepository.java
├── **model** or **domain** (Shared Components)
│   ├── User.java          // JPA Entities, Domain Objects
│   └── Order.java
├── **dto** or **viewmodel** (Data Transfer Objects)
│   ├── UserDto.java       // Data for API communication (Presentation/Service)
│   └── OrderRequest.java
└── **config**
    └── WebConfig.java     // Application configuration
```

## Package Responsibilities Summary

| Package Name | Layer | Purpose | Key Responsibilities | 
 | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| **`controller`** | Presentation | Acts as the entry point for clients (web or mobile). | Receives HTTP requests, performs basic input validation, and returns HTTP responses. Calls methods in the **`service`** package. | 
| **`service`** | Business Logic | Contains the core application rules, logic, and transaction management. | Implements and enforces business rules. Orchestrates calls to the **`repository`** and other services. | 
| **`repository`** (or `dao`) | Data Access | Isolates the application from the persistence technology (database). | Performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Translates data between Java objects and database records. | 
| **`model`** (or `domain`) | Shared | Holds the core entities that represent the real-world business objects. | These objects (`User`, `Order`, etc.) are often used by all three main layers (**`controller`**, **`service`**, **`repository`**). | 


Strict Dependency Flow (Recommended)
The layer hierarchy is strictly enforced through these package dependencies:

controller → service

service → repository

repository → Database

The controller should never directly access the repository. All data operations must pass through the service layer to ensure business rules and transactions are properly applied.
